### Regular Expressions
This lesson explains how to use the java.util.regex API for pattern matching with regular expressions. Although the syntax accepted by this package is similar to the Perl programming language, knowledge of Perl is not a prerequisite. This lesson starts with the basics, and gradually builds to cover more advanced techniques.
