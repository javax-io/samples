### Date-Time Overview
Time seems to be a simple subject; even an inexpensive watch can provide a reasonably accurate date and time. However, with closer examination, you realize the subtle complexities and many factors that affect your understanding of time. For example, the result of adding one month to January 31 is different for a leap year than for other years. Time zones also add complexity. For example, a country may go in and out of daylight saving time at short notice, or more than once a year or it may skip daylight saving time entirely for a given year.
