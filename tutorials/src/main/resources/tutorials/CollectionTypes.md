### Collections
The Java collections framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structure. It helps making programming job easier and faster. These are the most important collection interfaces:

**Collection**
>A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements.

**List**
>An ordered collection. It can contain duplicate elements.

**Map**
>A collection that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.

**Set**
>A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.

**Queue**
>A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.

**Deque**
>A linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends.

**SortedSet**
>A Set that maintains its elements in ascending order.

**SortedMap**
>A Map that maintains its mappings in ascending key order
