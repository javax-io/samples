### Flow Statements
Control flow statements alter the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

**if-then**
>The if-then statement is the most basic of all the control flow statements. It tells your program to execute a certain section of code only if a particular test evaluates to true

**if-then-else**
>The if-then-else statement provides a secondary path of execution when an `if` clause evaluates to false.

**switch**
>Unlike if-then and if-then-else statements, the switch statement can have a number of possible execution paths. A switch works with the `byte`, `short`, `char`, and `int` primitive data types as well as `String` and `Enum`.

**while**
>The while statement continually executes a block of statements while a particular condition is true.

**do-while**
>The difference between do-while and while is that do-while evaluates its expression at the bottom of the loop instead of the top.

**for**
>The for statement provides a compact way to iterate over a range of values. It's referred as the "for loop" because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied.

**break**
>The unlabeled break statement uses to terminate a for, while, or do-while loop. There is also a rarely use labeled break.
