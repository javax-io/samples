### Programming Concepts
If you've never used an object-oriented programming language before, you'll need to learn a few basic concepts before you can begin writing any code. This snippet will introduce you to objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and packages.

**Class**
>A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It models the state and behavior of a real-world object. To define a class in java, you use the keyword `class`

**Nested Class**
>A nested class is a member of its enclosing class. Non-static nested classes (inner classes) have access to other members of the enclosing class. Static nested classes do not have access to other members of the enclosing class.

**Interface**
>An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world. When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface. To define an interface in java, you use the keyword `interface`

**Inheritance**
>Inheritance lets you create classes that are derived from other classes. A class that's based on another class inherits the other class states and behaviors. The class that is inherited is the base class or the superclass. To define a class or an interface inherits from others, you use keyword `extends` or `implements`

**Object**
>An object is an instance of a class which has its states and behaviors. To create an object in java, you use the keyword `new`

**Package**
>A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner. Organize your code into packages makes it easier to manage a large project. To define a package in java, you use keyword `package`

**Enum**
>Enum is specialized class that allow you to define and use sets of constants

**Method**
>Method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation

**Constructor**
>A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

**Field**
>Field is member variable defined in a class.
