### [Random Web Surfer](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/16pagerank)
Communicating across the web has become an integral part of everyday life. This communication is enabled in part by scientific studies of the structure of the web. We consider a simple model, known as the random-surfer model. We consider the web to be a fixed set of pages, with each page containing a fixed set of hyperlinks, and each link a reference to some other page. We study what happens to a person (the random surfer) who randomly moves from page to page, either by typing a page name into the address bar or by clicking a link on the current page.
