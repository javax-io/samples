### [Input and Output](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/15inout)
In this section we extend the set of simple abstractions (command-line input and standard output) that we have been using as the interface between our Java programs and the outside world to include standard input, standard drawing, and standard audio. Standard input makes it convenient for us to write programs that process arbitrary amounts of input and to interact with our programs; standard draw makes it possible for us to work with graphics; and standard audio adds sound.
